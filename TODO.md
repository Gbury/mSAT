# Goals

## Main goals

- Add a backend to send proofs to dedukti
    * First, pure resolution proofs
    * Then, require theories to output lemma proofs for dedukti (in some format yet to be decided)
- Allow to plug one's code into boolean propagation
    * react upon propagation (possibly by propagating more, or side-effect)
    * more advanced/specific propagation (2-clauses)?
    * implement 'constraints' (see https://www.lri.fr/~conchon/TER/2013/3/minisat.pdf )

## Long term goals

- max-sat/max-smt
- coq proofs ?
