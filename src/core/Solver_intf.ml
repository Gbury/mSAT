(** Interface for Solvers

    This modules defines the safe external interface for solvers.
    Solvers that implements this interface can be obtained using the [Make]
    functor in {!Solver} or {!Mcsolver}.

      of the sat solver.

  eval_level: 'form -> bool * int;
  (** Return the current assignement of the literals, as well as its
      decision level. If the level is 0, then it is necessary for
      the atom to have this value; otherwise it is due to choices
      that can potentially be backtracked.
      @raise UndecidedLit if the literal is not decided *)
  iter_trail : ('form -> unit) -> ('term -> unit) -> unit;
  (** Iter thorugh the formulas and terms in order of decision/propagation
      (starting from the first propagation, to the last propagation). *)
  model: unit -> ('term * 'value) list;
  (** Returns the model found if the formula is satisfiable. *)
}
(** The type of values returned when the solver reaches a SAT state. *)

  unsat_conflict : unit -> 'clause;
  (** Returns the unsat clause found at the toplevel *)
  get_proof : unit -> 'proof;
  (** returns a persistent proof of the empty clause from the Unsat result. *)

  | Unknown                       (** The given formula does not have an evaluation *)
  | Valued of bool * ('term list) (** The given formula can be evaluated to the given bool.
                                      The list of terms to give is the list of terms that
                                      were effectively used for the evaluation. *)
(** The type of evaluation results for a given formula.
    For instance, let's suppose we want to evaluate the formula [x * y = 0], the
    following result are correct:
    - [Unknown] if neither [x] nor [y] are assigned to a value
    - [Valued (true, [x])] if [x] is assigned to [0]
    - [Valued (true, [y])] if [y] is assigned to [0]
    - [Valued (false, [x; y])] if [x] and [y] are assigned to 1 (or any non-zero number)
*)

type ('term, 'formula, 'value) assumption =
  | Lit of 'formula  (** The given formula is asserted true by the solver *)
  | Assign of 'term * 'value (** The term is assigned to the value *)
(** Asusmptions made by the core SAT solver. *)

type ('term, 'formula, 'proof) reason =
  | Eval of 'term list
  (** The formula can be evalutaed using the terms in the list *)
  | Consequence of (unit -> 'formula list * 'proof)
  (** [Consequence (l, p)] means that the formulas in [l] imply the propagated
      formula [f]. The proof should be a proof of the clause "[l] implies [f]".

      invariant: in [Consequence (fun () -> l,p)], all elements of [l] must be true in
      the current trail.

      {b note} on lazyiness: the justification is suspended (using [unit -> â€¦])
      to avoid potentially costly computations that might never be used
      if this literal is backtracked without participating in a conflict.
      Therefore the function that produces [(l,p)] needs only be safe in
      trails (partial models) that are conservative extensions of the current
      trail.
      If the theory isn't robust w.r.t. extensions of the trail (e.g. if
      its internal state undergoes significant changes),
      it can be easier to produce the explanation eagerly when
      propagating, and then use [Consequence (fun () -> expl, proof)] with
      the already produced [(expl,proof)] tuple.
