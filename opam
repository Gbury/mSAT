synopsis: "A library to create SAT/SMT/McSat solvers"
description:
"mSAT is a library intended to make creating new SMT/McSat solvers easier.

mSAT implements a SAT solver core functorized over a theory. It thus provides
functors that take an arbitrary theory (either for SMT or McSat), and returns
a functionning SMT or McSat solver.

mSAT solvers support arbitrarily nested local assumptions. Solvers creates
using mSAT functors can adidtionally provide formal proofs whenever the
solver answers UNSAT on a problem.
